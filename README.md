## ARGO
*Green Industries* was originally a submission for ARGO, a project shared between all of our final year modules and incorporating a piece of each of the four; Gameplay Programming II, AI for Games, Online Gaming Technologies, and Real World Modelling.

The game was developed as a team following SOLID principles using an AGILE methodology and implementing tests to ensure code quality.

Development is planned to continue to ready the project for the Games Fleadh competition.
